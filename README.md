Hereâ€™s an intermediate-level Laravel project idea to help you build your skills:

---

## **Project Name**: Task Management System

### **Project Overview**:

A Task Management System allows users to manage tasks, organize them into projects, assign them to team members, and set deadlines. The system includes user roles (Admin, Manager, and Member) and features for collaboration, task tracking, and reporting.

---

### **Core Features**:

#### 1. **User Authentication**

-   Use Laravel Breeze or Laravel Fortify for authentication.
-   Allow user registration and login with email/password.
-   Password reset functionality.

#### 2. **User Roles**

-   Implement roles: Admin, Manager, Member. 
-   Use Laravel Policies or Gates to handle permissions.

#### 3. **Projects**

-   CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for projects.
-   Each project should have:
    -   Title
    -   Description
    -   Start Date
    -   End Date
    -   Assigned Team Members

#### 4. **Tasks**

-   CRUD operations for tasks.
-   Each task should have:
    -   Title
    -   Description
    -   Status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
    -   Priority (e.g., Low, Medium, High)
    -   Due Date
    -   Assigned User (Member)
    -   Associated Project

#### 5. **Team Management**

-   Admin/Manager can add or remove members from a project.
-   Role assignment for team members.

#### 6. **Dashboard**

-   Overview of all projects and tasks for the user.
-   Display upcoming deadlines, pending tasks, and completed tasks.

#### 7. **Notifications**

-   Notify team members when a task is assigned or updated.
-   Use Laravel Notifications or integrate with a real-time solution like Pusher.

#### 8. **Search and Filters**

-   Search for tasks and projects.
-   Filters for status, priority, deadlines, and assigned users.

#### 9. **Reports**

-   Generate project/task status reports.
-   Provide insights like completed tasks vs. pending tasks.

#### 10. **Activity Log**

-   Track changes made to tasks and projects (e.g., status updates, assignments).
-   Use Laravel's activity log package or manually implement it.

---

### **Advanced Features (Optional)**:

-   Real-time task updates using Laravel Echo or WebSockets.
-   File attachments for tasks and projects (e.g., documents, images).
-   Task comments for collaboration between team members.
-   Integration with third-party tools like Google Calendar or Slack.

---

### **Tech Stack**:

-   **Frontend**: Blade Templates or Vue.js/React.js for a single-page application (optional).
-   **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL.
-   **Authentication**: Laravel Breeze, Fortify, or Sanctum (if API-based).
-   **Testing**: PHPUnit for feature and unit testing.

---

### **Implementation Steps**:

1. **Set up Laravel Project**

    - Install Laravel and configure the environment.
    - Set up database migrations for users, roles, projects, and tasks.

2. **Build the Authentication System**

    - Implement user authentication with roles.

3. **Create Models, Migrations, and Relationships**

    - Define relationships between models (e.g., Users, Projects, Tasks).

4. **Develop CRUD Functionality**

    - Create controllers, routes, and Blade views for projects and tasks.

5. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

    - Use Gates or Policies to restrict access based on roles.

6. **Build the Dashboard**

    - Use Laravel Charts or similar libraries to display data visually.

7. **Add Notifications**

    - Use Laravel's notification system for email and real-time notifications.

8. **Test the Application**

    - Write tests for critical features.

9. **Deploy**
    - Deploy the application using a hosting service like Laravel Forge, DigitalOcean, or AWS.

---

### **Project Benefits**:

This project will help you:

-   Understand user roles and permissions.
-   Work with advanced features like notifications and real-time updates.
-   Practice CRUD operations and model relationships.
-   Learn to integrate reporting and analytics in a web application.
